# Blackjack

This is a simple Blackjack game I created to learn [Angular](https://angular.dev).

In its current state, you can hit to draw cards. The game will detect if you bust. When you stand, the dealer's cards will be revealed to see who wins! 

TO DO: Dealer decides whether to hit when player stands.
